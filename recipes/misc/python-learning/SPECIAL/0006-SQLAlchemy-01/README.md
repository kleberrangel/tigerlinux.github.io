## Python and SQLAlchemy - SQLite.

The exercise in this directory (`sqlalchemy-sqlite.py`) show one of the many ways you can use python to perform simple database operations. We are basing this exercise on SQLAlchemy 1.0.x. Take into account changes between SQLAlchemy versions if you use another version.


## Dependencies needed for this exercise.

Apart from python (of course), you'll need sqlalchemy. You can install it from your O/S distro, or, by using `pip install`:

**Generic Python Version**

```bash
pip install sqlachemy
```

**OS with both version 2 and 3... like Fedora 22,23 or 24**

```bash
pip2 install sqlalchemy
pip3 install sqlalchemy
```

Also, you should have installed SQLITE. This script was tested on a **Fedora 24** machine with sqlite 3 installed.
