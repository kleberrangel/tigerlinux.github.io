## Special Cases Section:

In general, the excercises here are designed to run in both python 2.7 or 3.x, but, there are some cases where 3.x will not work. Every excercise is fully documented (in-line) so you can see what is being doing inside every script here !.

This section will be continually updated with special cases covering a lot of more advanced, real-life things you can do with python. If you have a specific sugestion about what should I include here beside what I already planning to include, please contact me and I'll try my best to do it.
