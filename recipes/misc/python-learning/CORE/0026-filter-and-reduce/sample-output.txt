My original list is: [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Our new list is (using looped function): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Our new list is (using simple filter call with a lambda function): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

My sum is (using a sum function with the list: [2, 4, 1, 3]): 10
My sum is (using reduce with the list: [2, 4, 1, 3]): 10
