## Core Programming Section:

In general, the exercises here are designed to run in both python 2.7 or 3.x, but, there are some cases where 3.x will not work. Every exercise is fully documented (in-line) so you can see what is being doing inside every script here !.

Remember this section is basic core programming. It include almost all python core programming offer, from simple print and attribute manipulation, to a things more complex like descriptors, decorators and metaclasses.

If you think something else must be included or extended in this section, please contact me and I'll try to include it.
