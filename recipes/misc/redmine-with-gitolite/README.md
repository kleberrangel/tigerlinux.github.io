## Introduction:

If you do I.T. development projects "the right way", you surelly use both project-tracking and version-control tools. Sites like GitHub can provide to you the "version-control" part with it's git-based repositories, and even you can set some tools to help you do the project-tracking part, but, if you need "serious" project tracking, you need something like Redmine.

[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) is one of the best project-tracking solutions in the OpenSource world, and also it's very extensible due it's plugin-based approach.

Now, what if you need to provision local repositories in your workplace, and also have your un redmine server fully integrated with a git-provisioning solution ?. Then this recipe is for you!.

In this recipe, we'll show you how to install your very own redmine, and, integrate to it a git-provisioning solution trough redmine-plugins.


## Our Recipe:

This recipe is based on Centos 7 with EPEL repo. Of course you can use RHEL or Scientific Linux too if you want, but, the EPEL repo is **mandatory** due the fact that some of the packages used by our recipe are located in EPEL.
